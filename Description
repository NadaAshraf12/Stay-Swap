• The platform allows members to arrange homestays and cultural exchanges.
• The volunteers/travelers are expected to contribute a pre-agreed amount of time per day in exchange for lodging
and food, which their host provides.
• Hosts register on the platform and are expected to provide information about themselves, the type of help they
require to be performed, the accommodation they offer, and the sort of person they expect.
• The volunteers/travelers create an online profile, including personal details and any specific skills they might have.
Afterward, they can contact hosts through the website and discuss a possible exchange.
• The platform is aimed at budget travelers and language learners looking to become more immersed in the country
and culture they are journeying through while allowing local hosts to meet like-minded people who can provide
the help they require. Thus, it is a helpful way to improve foreign language skills and an opportunity to develop
new talents and learn about local traditions.
• The opportunities are varied and based in a wide range of countries worldwide. Some types of volunteering
available include gardening, animal care, cooking, farming, and more specialist and niche help requests.
• One of the benefits for potentially isolated communities or people is the chance to bring the world to them via
travelers using the site. Travelers can then profit from their host's knowledge of regional places of interest and
their local environment.
• The platform may charge the travelers a yearly membership fee to connect to hosts but does not charge the host
a fee to list.
• The duration of an exchange can range from as little as a few days to over a year.
